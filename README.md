# usp_executesql_parallel

This is a rough sample of how to to do parallel server-side TSQL execution.

The entry point looks like:

 

```SQL
exec usp_executesql_parallel @queryForBatchList= "select * from #batches", @maxDegreeOfParalellism = 4, @connectionString = null, @debug=true;
```

 
The first argument is a query that is executed in the current session, and returns the list of batches to execute, and optionally the connectionString to execute each one.  Youâ€™d normally just load the queries into a local temp table, and the proc will read them from there.
